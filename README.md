# HelpingHandActual
Currently it can create a new post, allow user to view posts from other users within range, save other users' post by double clicking, and notify other user that user has offered a "helping hand" out
Has a sign in form
Possible improvements: Currently no delete post function(kind of hard to delete from firebase and delete from feed-see in code) and no multiuser selection
SIDENOTE: Displaying posts or creating new posts only works when there are 4 POSTS OR LESS!!!
